    The white cross has been used as the field sign (attached to the clothing of combatants and to the cantonal war flags in the form of strips of linen) of the Old Swiss Confederacy since its formation in the late 13th or early 14th century.

   <h2>Although Switzerland is without an official capital, the city of Bern is the de-facto seat of government in the country.

Before 1848, the cantons of Zurich, Berne, and Lucerne hosted the Confederal Diet in two-year rotations. In 1848, however, it was decided that the city of Bern in the canton of Bern would from then on host the seat of government. Although it is referred to as the Federal City and the de-facto capital of Switzerland, officially it is neither.
